# Hi!

My name is Marcin and I am a software engineer with a deep interest in information security. I lead the Product Security team at [Auth0](https://auth0.com), an identity platform for application builders.

# Open Source Security

I am also a member of the [Node.js Ecosystem Security Working Group](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg) under the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/). My work is focused on running the [bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/nodejs-ecosystem) for third-party Node.js packages.

# Teaching

I am passionate about building secure applications and promoting security best practices. I blog at [marcinhoppe.com](https://marcinhoppe.com) and publish [online courses](https://marcinhoppe.com/courses/) to educate software developers about information security.
